# Word-Book
In order to learn English, a software has functions such as looking up words, quiz, translation, and recognizing texts

## Part Ⅰ Purpose
This software was to help learn English, and it was my father who first proposed that he needed a software that could test whether or not to memorize the words. 
According to his request, I started to try to make this software, and then I tried to add more functions to it, such as querying the meaning of words, and then creating your own word book, connecting Baidu Translate's API and Baidu Text Recognition API to translate text and recognize text in pictures, and then the current software was completed.

## Part Ⅱ Installation
Unzip the wordbook_v2.1 archive in it, and then find the wordbook_v2.1 application file to run, but it should be noted that local text recognition may have a little performance requirements on your computer

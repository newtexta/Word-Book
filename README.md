# Word-Book
In order to learn English, a software has functions such as looking up words, quiz, translation, and recognizing texts

## Part Ⅰ Purpose
This software was to help learn English, and it was my father who first proposed that he needed a software that could test whether or not to memorize the words. 
According to his request, I started to try to make this software, and then I tried to add more functions to it, such as querying the meaning of words, and then creating your own word book, connecting Baidu Translate's API and Baidu Text Recognition API to translate text and recognize text in pictures, and then the current software was completed.

## Part Ⅱ Installation
If you want to run it successfully, you should decompress the four packages starting with "gb", create a new folder named "gb_mp3", copy all the files to the "gb_mp3" folder, similarly, create a new "us_mp3" folder, and extract the package starting with "us" and copy its Chinese to the "us_mp3" folder, you also need to unzip the "words" package.What's more, you need to download TTSMaker, the path should be " ./TTSMaker/TTSMakerTTSMaker.exe", so that your program can run normally, and the packaged program is limited by GitHub upload restrictions, please contact me by email to get the software.
